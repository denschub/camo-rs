# Using released binaries

For stable releases, Linux amd64 binaries will be compiled and attached to the release. For other systems or architectures, please [build from source](/docs/from-source.md).

Check the [Releases page](https://github.com/denschub/camo-rs/releases) to find the latest release and download the binary archive. Place the binary somewhere, for example in `/usr/bin/camo`. You have to decide how to run that binary in the background, but [a systemd-unit is provided here](/docs/systemd-unit.md).

## Development builds

For the `main` branch, GitHub Actions builds optimized binary artifacts as well. Click on [the latest run of the `build` job](https://github.com/denschub/camo-rs/actions/workflows/build.yml) to see the artifacts. The binaries generated by this task are functionally identical to the Release builds, but they're based on the latest `main` sources.
